# DENIM TEARS x COMPLEX
## Deck Structure, Messaging & Copy Brief

---

## SLIDE 1: TITLE

**Copy:**
```
DENIM TEARS x COMPLEX
```

**Design Direction:**
- Clean, confident, equal weight to both brands
- This is a collaboration lockup, not "Complex featuring Denim Tears"
- Consider a treatment that visually signals partnership—the "x" matters
- Black background, white typography, minimal
- No tagline, no date—just the pairing

---

## SLIDE 2: THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT

**Copy:**
```
Denim Tears is more than a clothing brand.

It's a practice—a way of embedding history, memory, and meaning
into the objects and images that move through culture.

From the cotton wreath to the collaborations with Levi's, Dior,
Converse, and beyond, Tremaine Emory has built something rare:
a brand that teaches as it creates, that honors the past
while shaping what comes next.

Complex has watched this work with deep respect.

Now we want to build something together.
```

**Design Direction:**
- This slide is about *seeing* Tremaine, not explaining him to himself
- Typography-forward, minimal imagery
- Could pull a subtle visual reference to Denim Tears' visual language (the cotton motif, the botanical elements) but don't overdo it
- The tone is reverent but not fawning—peer to peer

---

## SLIDE 3: THE PROPOSITION

**Copy:**
```
When Denim Tears collaborates with Levi's, you get denim with your DNA.
When Denim Tears collaborates with Dior, you get fashion with your DNA.

We're proposing something different:

Denim Tears x Complex.
A collaboration between a cultural brand and a media brand.

You bring your vision, your taste, your point of view.
We bring the platform, the infrastructure, the audience.

The output: a cover story, a slate of original content,
and a capsule collection—all shaped by you.
```

**Design Direction:**
- This is the hinge of the deck—the reframe
- The first two lines establish the pattern (his existing collaborations)
- The proposition breaks the pattern: this is media, not product
- Clean, typographic, let the words land
- Consider a visual beat or divider before "We're proposing something different"

## SLIDE 4: THE COVER AS ANCHOR

**Copy:**
```
THE COMPLEX COVER

For 20+ years, the Complex cover has been a cultural marker—
a platform for the artists, athletes, designers, and icons
who define their moments.

Nas. Kendrick. Zendaya. The Weeknd. Kid Cudi. KAWS.

This is where it starts.

The cover is the anchor—the artifact that announces
a Denim Tears x Complex moment to the world.

You choose the subject. You choose the photographer.
You shape the image. You could be on it yourself.

This is your canvas.
```

**Design Direction:**
- This is where you bring in the cover archive—but curated, not exhaustive
- Select 4-6 iconic covers that speak to the range and cultural weight
- The copy frames the cover as the *starting point*, not the totality
- End on "This is your canvas"—the invitation to create

---

## SLIDE 5: THE CANVAS — CONTENT

**Copy:**
```
BEYOND THE COVER

The cover is the catalyst. What surrounds it is yours to define.

This could be:

A long-form interview with a legend you admire—or a conversation
between two people you think the world needs to hear from.

A curated list: the most important Black creatives every
Complex reader should know, selected by you.

A tribute to Queens—the borough that shaped you.

A meditation on the downtown New York scene of the late '90s:
the streetwear, the hip-hop, the energy that built this culture.

An interactive feature tracing the hero's journey of a brand—
how something goes from idea to icon.

A piece of commissioned fiction from a writer you believe in.

A video series. A photo essay. A week of content you orchestrate.

The format is open. The platform is yours.
```

**Design Direction:**
- This slide can be longer or broken into two if needed
- The point is to show BREADTH—not to prescribe, but to invite
- Each example should feel like a door opening, not a checkbox
- Visually, this could be typographic with subtle imagery, or it could have light visual references to the concepts (Queens, downtown NYC, etc.)
- The examples are specific enough to be evocative but open enough to leave room for his ideas

---

## SLIDE 6: THE CANVAS — COMMERCE

**Copy:**
```
DENIM TEARS x COMPLEX
THE COLLECTION

This isn't merch. This is a brand collaboration.

A capsule collection—apparel, accessories, and beyond—
designed in partnership, sold through Complex Shop,
with revenue shared.

The same model as your collaborations with Levi's or Converse,
applied to a media partnership.

Product that carries the DNA of both brands.
Product that extends the moment beyond the screen.
```

**Design Direction:**
- Show precedent: the BAPE x YoungBoy collection, the Clipse x KAWS collection, the Billie x NBA hats
- But frame these as "here's the model" not "here's what we did"
- The copy emphasizes: this is real commerce, real partnership, real revenue participation
- Consider showing a range of product types to suggest possibility (apparel, accessories, maybe hint at CPG if relevant)

---

## SLIDE 7: THE AMPLIFICATION

**Copy:**
```
THE COMPLEX ECOSYSTEM

Everything you create gets the full weight of Complex behind it.

80M+ social followers and subscribers.
600M+ monthly cross-platform video views.
#1 reach among males 18-34.

Editorial. Social. YouTube. Email.
Integrated marketing. Press.

Flagship retail on Fairfax Ave in Los Angeles
and Broadway in New York—spaces for pop-ups,
activations, and real-world moments.

Your vision. Our infrastructure.
```

**Design Direction:**
- This is where the scale lives—but framed as "in service of your vision"
- The stats should feel like capability, not boasting
- Include imagery of the Complex ecosystem: the stores, ComplexCon, social reach
- End on "Your vision. Our infrastructure."—that's the relationship

---

## SLIDE 8: THE INVITATION

**Copy:**
```
This is an invitation to create something
that could only exist because we made it together.

A Denim Tears moment, through the lens of Complex.

Let's talk.
```

**Design Direction:**
- Simple. Warm. Direct.
- This is not "Thank You"—this is the beginning of a conversation
- Logo lockup at the bottom (Denim Tears x Complex) to bookend
- Consider adding contact information or a personal sign-off from Noah if appropriate
- The tone is confident but open—an invitation, not a hard close

---

## ADDITIONAL NOTES FOR DESIGNER

**Overall Tone:**
- This deck should feel like a letter, not a pitch
- Confident but not corporate
- Reverent but peer-to-peer
- Warm but professional

**Visual Language:**
- Lean into clean typography—let the words breathe
- Black backgrounds work (consistent with original deck) but consider moments of warmth
- Reference Denim Tears' aesthetic where appropriate (botanical elements, cotton motif, historical imagery) but don't appropriate—acknowledge
- The cover archive imagery is an asset; use it strategically, not exhaustively

**Length:**
- 8 slides is the target
- Slide 5 (The Canvas — Content) can expand to 2 slides if needed for visual breathing room
- Resist the urge to add more; this should feel curated, not comprehensive

**What This Deck Is:**
- An invitation to collaborate
- A demonstration that Complex understands who Tremaine is and what Denim Tears represents
- A clear articulation of the opportunity: cover + content + commerce
- A signal that the creative latitude is real and wide

**What This Deck Is Not:**
- A capabilities deck
- A media kit
- An exhaustive list of deliverables
- A contract or formal proposal

The goal is for Tremaine to finish this deck and think: "They get it. And this could be interesting."

## OPTIONAL: ACCOMPANYING NOTE

If this deck is being sent rather than presented, consider a brief personal note from Noah that lives outside the deck:

```
Tremaine—

I've been thinking about this since our conversation at the Nas party.

Complex has never done anything quite like what we're proposing here,
but the more I thought about it, the more it felt right. You've built
something with Denim Tears that goes beyond product—it's a point of view,
a practice, a way of moving through culture.

We want to put our platform in service of that.

Take a look at the attached. I'd love to talk through it whenever
you have time. No rush—but I'm genuinely excited about what this could be.

Hope you and the family are well. Maybe we grab a coffee next time
we're both down there.

—Noah
```

This personal note does the relational work; the deck does the professional work. Together, they're the full picture.
